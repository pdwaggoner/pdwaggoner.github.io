## Welcome!

My name is Philip Waggoner. I am a data scientist at [Edison Software](https://www.edison.tech/). 

I am also a research scholar at the Institute for Social and Economic Research and Policy ([ISERP](http://iserp.columbia.edu/people/philip-d-waggoner){:target="_blank"}) at Columbia University. In collaboration with [Robert Y. Shapiro](https://www.sipa.columbia.edu/faculty-research/faculty-directory/robert-shapiro){:target="_blank"}, we are working on a number of experimental and computational projects exploring social media data.

In a former (and recent) life, I was member of the [graduate computational social science](https://macss.uchicago.edu/directory/philip-waggoner){:target="_blank"} faculty at the University of Chicago. Some of my old syllabi can be found [here](/Teach.md).

For more information, see my [resume](https://www.dropbox.com/s/0eq237s7arqh7yv/Philip%20Waggoner_Resume.pdf?dl=0){:target="_blank"} (short) or [CV](https://www.dropbox.com/s/ikt228v5lmobro2/Philip%20Waggoner_CV.pdf?dl=0){:target="_blank"} (long).
