## Welcome!

My name is Philip Waggoner and I am the Director of Data Science at [YouGov America](https://today.yougov.com/?utm_source=twitter&utm_medium=twitter_link&utm_campaign=profile_bio_link){:target="_blank"}, and an Adjunct Professor of Data Science at the [University of Virginia](https://datascience.virginia.edu/){:target="_blank"}, and the [University of Denver](https://ritchieschool.du.edu/academics-education/gr-programs/ms-data-science){:target="_blank"}.

I am also a research scholar at the Institute for Social and Economic Research and Policy ([ISERP](http://iserp.columbia.edu/people/philip-d-waggoner){:target="_blank"}) at Columbia University, where I have the pleasure of working a lot with [Robert Y. Shapiro](https://www.sipa.columbia.edu/faculty-research/faculty-directory/robert-shapiro){:target="_blank"}.

Formerly, I was a data scientist at Edison Software (now Yipit Data), and before that a member of the graduate computational social science faculty at the University of Chicago. Some of my old courses can be found [here](/Teach.md).

On the side, I am excited about the [Portfolio Project](https://ccdportfolio.netlify.app/){:target="_blank"}, which is a technology resource I built and maintain as a member of the *American Statistical Association* Committee on Career Development.
