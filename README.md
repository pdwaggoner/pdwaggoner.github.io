## Welcome!

My name is Philip Waggoner and I am the Director of Data Science at YouGov America.

I am also a research scholar at the Institute for Social and Economic Research and Policy ([ISERP](http://iserp.columbia.edu/people/philip-d-waggoner){:target="_blank"}) at Columbia University, where I have the pleasure of working a lot with [Robert Y. Shapiro](https://www.sipa.columbia.edu/faculty-research/faculty-directory/robert-shapiro){:target="_blank"}.

Additionally I am an active member of the American Statistical Association serving on a couple committees. As a member of the Committee on Career Development (CCD), I built, maintain, and occasionally post at the CCD's [Portfolio Project blog](https://ccdportfolio.netlify.app/){:target="_blank"}. *Please [reach out directly](mailto:philip.waggoner@yougov.com) if you'd like to contribute a post to the blog re: data science, statistics, professional development, practical interaction with technology, etc.*

Formerly, I was a data scientist at Edison Software (now Yipit Data), and before that a member of the graduate computational social science faculty at the University of Chicago. Some of my old syllabi can be found [here](/Teach.md).
