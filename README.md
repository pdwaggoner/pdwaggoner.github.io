## Welcome!

My name is Philip Waggoner. I have been extremely fortunate to have worked with some incredible people over the years. 

I have served in a variety of capacities such as Director of Data Science at YouGov, Senior Research Scientist in the Department of Applied Mathematics and Statistics at the Colorado School of Mines, Data Scientist at the Center for the Governance of AI at Oxford, and a few others. 

> Throughout my work, regardless of the context, I've maintained a deep commitment to open source software development and open science more broadly. 

I did my postdoc at Stanford University at the School of Medicine, advised by [Pascal Geldsetzer](https://profiles.stanford.edu/pascal-geldsetzer){:target="_blank"} in the Division of Primary Care and Population Health, where I am currently an Affiliate.

I have held or currently hold formal appointments at: Columbia University (ISERP), the University of Chicago (computational social science), Johns Hopkins University (analytics and policy), Northwestern University (data science), the University of Virginia (data science), the Colorado School of Mines (Applied Mathematics and Statistics), and the College of William & Mary (government).
