#### >> American Statistical Association Portfolio Project

On the side, I am excited about the [Portfolio Project](https://ccdportfolio.netlify.app/){:target="_blank"}, which is a technology resource I built and maintain as a member of the *American Statistical Association* Committee on Career Development. 

*Please [reach out directly](mailto:philip.waggoner@yougov.com)* if you'd like to contribute a post to the Portfolio Project blog re: data science, statistics, professional development, practical interaction with technology, etc.
