## American Statistical Association Portfolio Project

As a member of the *American Statistical Association* Committee on Career Development, I have worked with a great team to build the [Portfolio Project](https://ccdportfolio.netlify.app/){:target="_blank"}, which is a technology resource I maintain. A huge thanks to the great initial work done by Matt Krachey in laying the foundation for this resource.

The resource is meant to be a repository of tips, tricks, advcice, and thoughts related to career development in statistics, *very* broadly defined. 

*Please [reach out directly](mailto:philip.waggoner@yougov.com)* if you'd like to contribute a post to the Portfolio Project blog re: data science, statistics, professional development, practical interaction with technology, etc.
